## Setting the Scene

[Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever](https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/resources/denguedhf-information-for-health-care-practitioners_2009.pdf) (in short dengue fever) is one of the most widespread mosquito-borne diseases in the most tropical and subtropical regions. It is an acute disease caused by dengue virus infection which is transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In 2015, Taiwan had recorded the most severe dengue fever outbreak with more than 43,000 dengue cases and 228 deaths. Since then, the annual reported dengue fever cases were maintained at the level of not more than 200 cases. However, in 2023, Taiwan recorded 26703 dengue fever cases. Figure below reveals that more than 25,000 cases were reported at Tainan City.

## Objectives

As a curious geospatial analytics green horn, you are interested to discover:

-   if the distribution of dengue fever outbreak at Tainan City, Taiwan are independent from space and space and time.\
-   If the outbreak is indeed spatial and spatio-temporal dependent, then, you would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the emerging hot spot/cold spot areas.

## The Task

The specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:

-   Using appropriate function of **sf** and **tidyverse**, preparing the following geospatial data layer:
    -   a study area layer in sf polygon features. It must be at village level and confined to the D01, D02, D04, D06, D07, D08, D32 and D39 counties of Tainan City, Taiwan.\
    -   a dengue fever layer within the study area in sf point features. The dengue fever cases should be confined to epidemiology week 31-50, 2023.
    -   a derived dengue fever layer in [spacetime s3 class of sfdep](https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/articles/spacetime-s3). It should contain, among many other useful information, a data field showing number of dengue fever cases by village and by epidemiology week.
-   Using the extracted data, perform global spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex05/in-class_ex05-glsa).
-   Using the extracted data, perform local spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap10.html).
-   Using the extracted data, perform emerging hotspot analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex05/in-class_ex05-ehsa).
-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the analysis above.

## The Data

For the purpose of this take-home exercise, two data sets are provided, they are:

-   TAIWAN_VILLAGE_2020, a geospatial data of village boundary of Taiwan. It is in ESRI shapefile format. The data is in Taiwan Geographic Coordinate System. (Source: [Historical map data of the village boundary: TWD97 longitude and latitude](https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/130549))

-   Dengue_Daily.csv, an aspatial data of reported dengue cases in Taiwan since 1998. (Source: [Dengue Daily Confirmed Cases Since 1998](https://data.cdc.gov.tw/en/dataset/dengue-daily-determined-cases-1998). Below are selected fields that are useful for this study:

    -   發病日: Onset date
    -   最小統計區中心點X: x-coordinate
    -   最小統計區中心點Y: y-coordinate

Both data sets have been uploaded on eLearn. Students are required to download them from eLean.

## Grading Criteria

This exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:

-   **Geospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks):** This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability:

    -   to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the import and extract the data.
    -   to clean and derive appropriate variables for meeting the analysis need.

::: callout-warning
All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them.
:::

-   **Geospatial Analysis (30 marks):** In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation, and emerging hot spot analysis methods in class to perform the analysis. You will be assessed on your ability:

    -   to describe the methods used correctly, and
    -   to provide accurate interpretation of the analysis results.

-   **Geovisualisation and geocommunication (20 marks):** In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.

-   **Reproducibility (15 marks):** This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.

-   **Bonus (15 marks):** Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data.

## Submission Instructions

-   The write-up of the take-home exercise must be in **Quarto html document** format. You are required to publish the write-up on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).
-   Zip the take-home exercise folder and upload it onto eLearn. If the size of the zip file is beyond the capacity of eLearn, you can upload it on SMU OneDrive and provide the download link on eLearn..
