Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll acts of academic dishonesty (including, but not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, facilitation of acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of exam questions, or tampering with the academic work of other students) are serious offences. All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of assessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of the policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense.

    "text": "Course Assessment Details\n\nClass Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\nAY2021-22 Sample Take-home Exercises\n\nTake-home Exercise 1\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report."
