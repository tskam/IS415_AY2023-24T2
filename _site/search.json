    "text": "Course Assessment Details\n\nClass Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on real-world applications of geospatial analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThere are three take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real world cases.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\nAY2021-22 Sample Take-home Exercises\n\nTake-home Exercise 1\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the Geospatial Analytics Project is to provide students first-hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing spatial data using real world data. A project may involve creating geospatially enabled business data and subsequently analysing these data for business strategic or market analysis. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools or models within a web framework. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study.\nThe project is team work. Students are required to form a project team of 3 members by the third week of the academic term. Each project teams must start thinking about their project ideas between week 4 and week 7. They are expected to discuss their project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the weeks too. A project website will be prepared and submitted to the instructor for approval by the end of week 8.\nAll project teams will give a postal presentation outlining the database design and implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project in week 14. Students are also required to prepare a project report or research paper of not more than 15 pages (excluding maps, figures, and tables) for submission by week 14. Additional materials will be distributed in class to assist students with topics selection, project design, postal presentation, and project report."

    "section": "Introducing Shiny Module",
    "text": "Introducing Shiny Module\n\nAs Shiny applications grow larger and more complicated, modules are used to manage the growing complexity of Shiny application code.\nFunctions are the fundamental unit of abstraction in R, and we designed Shiny to work with them.\nWe can write UI-generating functions and call them from our app, and we can write functions to be used in the server function that define outputs and create reactive expressions.\n\n\n\nShiny Modules Workflow\n\n\nAn example of a large and complex Shiny application diagram.\n\n\nAn example of modulerised Shiny application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule basics\nA module is very similar to an app. Like an app, it’s composed of two pieces:\n\nThe module UI function that generates the ui specification.\nThe module server function that runs code inside the server function.\n\nThe two functions have standard forms. They both take an id argument and use it to namespace the module. To create a module, we need to extract code out of the app UI and server and put it in to the module UI and server.\n\n\n\nIn-class Exercise: Building Shiny App with Basic Modele\nIn order to understand the basics of Shiny modules, let us consider a simple Shiny application codes to plot a histogram shown below.\n\n\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  selectInput(\"var\", \n              \"Variable\", \n              names(mtcars)),\n  numericInput(\"bins\", \n               \"bins\", \n               10, \n               min = 1),\n  plotOutput(\"hist\")\n)\nserver &lt;- function(input, \n                   output, \n                   session) {\n  data &lt;- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])\n  output$hist &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(data(), \n         breaks = input$bins, \n         main = input$var)\n  }, res = 96)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule UI\nWe’ll start with the module UI. There are two steps:\n\nPut the UI code inside a function that has an id argument.\nWrap each existing ID in a call to NS(), so that (e.g.) “var” turns into NS(id, “var”).\n\n\nhistogramUI &lt;- function(id) {\n  tagList(\n    selectInput(NS(id, \"var\"), \"Variable\", choices = names(mtcars)),\n    numericInput(NS(id, \"bins\"), \"bins\", value = 10, min = 1),\n    plotOutput(NS(id, \"hist\"))\n  )\n}\n\n\nHere we have returned the UI components in a tagList(), which is a special type of layout function that allows you to bundle together multiple components without actually implying how they will be laid out.\nIt is the responsibility of the person calling histogramUI() to wrap the result in a layout function like column() or fluidRow() according to their needs.\n\n\n\n\nModule server\nNext we tackle the server function. This gets wrapped inside another function which must have an id argument. This function calls moduleServer() with the id, and a function that looks like a regular server function:\n\nhistogramServer &lt;- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    data &lt;- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])\n    output$hist &lt;- renderPlot({\n      hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)\n    }, res = 96)\n  })\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nmoduleServer() takes care of the namespacing automatically: inside of moduleServer(id),\ninput\\(var* and *input\\)bins refer to the inputs with names NS(id, “var”) and NS(id, “bins”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Shiny Application\nNow that we have the ui and server functions, it’s good practice to write a function that uses them to generate an app which we can use for experimentation and testing:\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    histogramUI(\"hist\")\n    )\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n    histogramServer(\"hist\")\n    }\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLike all Shiny control, you need to use the same id in both UI and server, otherwise the two pieces will not be connected.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class Exercise: Function to import csv file\n\n\n\n\nModule UI function\n\n# Module UI function\ncsvFileUI &lt;- function(id, label = \"CSV file\") {\n    # `NS(id)` returns a namespace function, which was save as `ns` and will\n    # invoke later.\n    ns &lt;- NS(id)\n    \n    tagList(\n        fileInput(ns(\"file\"), label),\n        checkboxInput(ns(\"heading\"), \"Has heading\"),\n        selectInput(ns(\"quote\"), \"Quote\", c(\n            \"None\" = \"\",\n            \"Double quote\" = \"\\\"\",\n            \"Single quote\" = \"'\"\n        ))\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n\nModule server function\n\ncsvFileServer &lt;- function(id, stringsAsFactors) {\n    moduleServer(\n        id,\n        function(input, output, session) {\n            userFile &lt;- reactive({\n                validate(need(input$file, message = FALSE))\n                input$file\n            })\n            dataframe &lt;- reactive({\n                read.csv(userFile()$datapath,\n                         header = input$heading,\n                         quote = input$quote,\n                         stringsAsFactors = stringsAsFactors)\n            })\n            observe({\n                msg &lt;- sprintf(\"File %s was uploaded\", userFile()$name)\n                cat(msg, \"\\n\")\n            })\n            return(dataframe)\n        }\n    )    \n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Shiny app\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            csvFileUI(\"datafile\", \"User data (.csv format)\")\n        ),\n        mainPanel(\n            dataTableOutput(\"table\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n    datafile &lt;- csvFileServer(\"datafile\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n    \n    output$table &lt;- renderDataTable({\n        datafile()\n    })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)"

This is the easiest case, because you’ll get a traceback which allows you to figure out exactly where the error occurred.\nYou don’t get any errors, but some value is incorrect. Here, you’ll need to use the interactive debugger, along with your investigative skills to track down the root cause.\nAll the values are correct, but they’re not updated when you expect. This is the most challenging problem because it’s unique to Shiny, so you can’t take advantage of your existing R debugging skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon errors\n\n“Object of type ‘closure’ is not subsettable”\n\nYou forgot to use () when retrieving a value from a reactive expression plot(userData) should be plot(userData())\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon errors\n\n“Unexpected symbol\n\n\n“Argument xxx is missing, with no default”\n\nMissing or extra comma in UI.\nSometimes Shiny will realise this and give you a hint, or use RStudio editor margin diagnostics.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon errors\n\n“Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)\n\nTried to access an input or reactive expression from directly inside the server function. You must use a reactive expression or observer instead.\nOr if you really only care about the value of that input at the time that the session starts, then use isolate()."

The next few functions are internal, and you can ignore them.\n\nFinally, at the very top, you’ll see the code that you have written:\n\nThis is the code called inside of renderPlot(). You can tell you should pay attention here because of the file path and line number; this lets you know that it’s your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you get an error in your app but don’t see a traceback then make sure that you’re running the app using Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter (or if not in RStudio, calling runApp()), and that you’ve saved the file that you’re running it from. Other ways of running the app don’t always capture the information necessary to make a traceback."

Such properties are usually measured with the so-called quadrat analysis, nearest neighbour index and kernel estimation. Second-order properties describe the covariance (or correlation) between values of the spatial point pattern at different regions in space and are usually measured with the G function, K function and L function. Applied to point event data, both properties could be used to explore the spatial variation in the risk of being victimized by a crime, spatial and space-time clustering of criminal activities, and the raised incidence of criminal activities around point sources, such as robberies around ATM machines, subway entrances and exits, etc."

    "text": "Introducing recursive partitioning\n\nA predictive methodology involving a dependent variable y and one and more predictors.\nThe dependent variable can be either a continuous or categorical scales.\nRules partition data into mutually exclusive groups.\nNo need to worry about transformations such as logs.\nNo prior distribution requirement.\n\n\n\nRecursive Partitioning as a Machine Learning engine\n\n\n\nAs a machine learning technique, recursive partitioning algorithms operate by building a model based on the training dataset and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of Recursive Partitioning\n\n\n\nIf the response is categorical, then it is fitting the probabilities estimated for the response levels, minimizing the residual log-likelihood chi-square [2*entropy].\n\n\n\nIf the response is continuous, then the platform fits means, minimizing the sum of squared errors. The earlier is popularly known as Classification Trees and the later is known as Regression Trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of Recursive Partitioning\n\n\n\nWorking with continuous predictor(s)\n\nIf a predictor is continuous, then the partition is done according to a splitting “cut” value for X. For example, Average Days Delinquent &lt; 12.3 or &gt;=12.3 as shown in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with categorical predictor(s)\n\nIf the predictor is categorical, then it divides the X categories into two groups of levels and considers all possible groupings into two levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of Classification and Regression Tree (CART)\n\n\nA CART is read from the top down starting at the root node.\n\nEach internal node represents a split based on the values of one of the inputs. The inputs can appear in any number of splits throughout the tree. Cases move down the branch that contains its input value.\nThe terminal nodes of the tree are called leaves. The leaves represent the predicted target. All cases reaching a particular leaf are given the same predicted value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful features and advantages of Recursive Partitioning\n\nRecursive partitioning is nonparametric and therefore does not rely on data belonging to a particular type of distribution.\nRecursive partitioning is not significantly impacted by outliers in the input variables.\nYou can relax stopping rules to “overgrow” decision trees and then prune back the tree to the optimal size. This approach minimizes the probability that important structure in the data set will be overlooked by stopping too soon.\nRecursive partitioning incorporates both testing with a test data set and cross-validation to assess the goodness of fit more accurately.\nRecursive partitioning can use the same variables more than once in different parts of the tree. This capability can uncover complex interdependencies between sets of variables.\nRecursive partitioning can be used in conjunction with other prediction methods to select the input set of variables."

    "text": "What is Geographical Segmentation?\n\n\n\nGeographic segmentation divides a target market by location so marketers can better serve customers in a particular area.\nThis type of market segmentation is based on the geographic units themselves (countries, states, cities, etc.), but also on various geographic factors, such as climate, cultural preferences, populations, and more.\nFor business applications of geographic segmentation, refer to this blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Geographic Segmentation\n\nIt’s an effective approach for companies with large national or international markets because different consumers in different regions have different needs, wants, and cultural characteristics that can be specifically targeted.\nIt can also be an effective approach for small businesses with limited budgets. They can focus on their defined area and not expend needless marketing dollars on approaches ill-suited for their target geographic segment.\nIt works well in different areas of population density. Consumers in an urban environment often have different needs and wants than people in suburban and rural environments. There are even cultural differences between these three areas."

    "text": "Hierarchical Clustering\n\nProduces a set of nested clusters organized as a hierarchical tree.\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical Methods\n\n\n\n\nAgglomerative clustering: It’s also known as AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting). It works in a bottom-up manner. That is, each object is initially considered as a single-element cluster (leaf). At each step of the algorithm, the two clusters that are the most similar are combined into a new bigger cluster (nodes). This procedure is iterated until all points are member of just one single big cluster (root). The result is a tree which can be plotted as a dendrogram.\nDivisive hierarchical clustering: It’s also known as DIANA (Divise Analysis) and it works in a top-down manner. The algorithm is an inverse order of AGNES. It begins with the root, in which all objects are included in a single cluster. At each step of iteration, the most heterogeneous cluster is divided into two. The process is iterated until all objects are in their own cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Proximity Matrix?\n\nMeasures of Similarity or Dissimilarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree commonly used methods to calculate proximity matrix\n\n\n\n\nProximity matrix: Euclidean distance\n\n\n\n\nProximity matrix: City-block distance\n\n\n\n\nProximity matrix: Chebychev distance\n\n\n\n\nAgglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms\n\nThe most common types methods are:\n\nMaximum or complete linkage clustering: It computes all pairwise dissimilarities between the elements in cluster 1 and the elements in cluster 2, and considers the largest value (i.e., maximum value) of these dissimilarities as the distance between the two clusters. It tends to produce more compact clusters.\nMinimum or single linkage clustering: It computes all pairwise dissimilarities between the elements in cluster 1 and the elements in cluster 2, and considers the smallest of these dissimilarities as a linkage criterion. It tends to produce long, “loose” clusters.\nMean or average linkage clustering: It computes all pairwise dissimilarities between the elements in cluster 1 and the elements in cluster 2, and considers the average of these dissimilarities as the distance between the two clusters.\nCentroid linkage clustering: It computes the dissimilarity between the centroid for cluster 1 (a mean vector of length p variables) and the centroid for cluster 2.\nWard’s minimum variance method: It minimizes the total within-cluster variance. At each step the pair of clusters with minimum between-cluster distance are merged.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms - Dendrograms\n\n\n\n\nCluster Analysis Process\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation\n\n\nTo perform a cluster analysis in R, generally, the data should be prepared as follows:\n\nRows are observations (individuals) and columns are variables.\nInput variables must be inline with the segmentation task.\nIdeally, the input variables must be in continuous data type.\nAny missing value in the data must be removed or estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivariate EDA\n\nChecking the distribution of the cluster variables, if their data ranges differences are very large then data standardisation is required.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable standardisation techniques"

    "text": "Setting the Scene\nHuman mobility, the movement of human beings in space and time, reflects the spatial-temporal characteristics of human behavior. With the advancement Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) especially smart phone, a large volume of data related to human mobility have been collected. By using appropriate GIS analysis methods, these data are potentially useful in supporting smart city planning and management.\nIn Singapore, one of the important source of data related to human mobility is from Land Transport Authority (LTA) DataMall. Two data sets related to human mobility are provided by the portal, they are: Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Train Stations and Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops. One of the limitation of these data sets is that their location are biased to either bus stops or MRT/LRT stations. In 2020, another very interesting human mobility data set called Grab Posisi was released by GRAB, one of the largest shared taxi operator in South-east Asia. There are two data sets been released and one of them is for Singapore."

    "section": "Grading Criteria",
    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need. (Warning: All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\nGeospatial Analysis (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate thematic and analytics mapping techniques and R functions introduced in class to analysis the geospatial data prepared. You will be assessed on your ability to derive analytical maps by using appropriate kernel estimation techniques.\nGeovisualisation and geocommunication (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (15 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (15 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data."

    "section": "Grading Criteria",
    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability:\n\nto employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readxl, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the import and extract the data.\nto clean and derive appropriate variables for meeting the analysis need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAll data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them.\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation, and emerging hot spot analysis methods in class to perform the analysis. You will be assessed on your ability:\n\nto describe the methods used correctly, and\nto provide accurate interpretation of the analysis results.\n\nGeovisualisation and geocommunication (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (15 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (15 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data."
